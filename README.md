# Project ecommerce using Ember.js

This is my first project using a JavaScript framework, in which I had a brush with ember.js. This is a simple ecommerce website where you have two products, which can be added to a shopping cart and it is updated automatically. By doing this code along project I got familiar with ember.js core concepts.
Hours spent in this project: 3h
